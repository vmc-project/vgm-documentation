# Virtual Geometry Model

**Virtual Geometry Model (VGM)**  is a geometry conversion tool, actually providing 
conversion between Geant4 and ROOT TGeo geometry models. Its design allows inclusion of 
another geometry model  by implementing a single sub-module instead of writing bilateral
converters for all already supported models.

VGM was implemented in the context of [Geant4 VMC](https://vmc-project.github.io/user-guide/geant4_vmc/). In 2017, it was moved from SourceForge into [GitHub](https://github.com/vmc-project/vgm) to become part of the VMC project packages in the [vmc-project](https://github.com/vmc-project) organization.
