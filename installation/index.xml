(See the VGM User Guide about other ways of VGM application.)
The test program includes several geometry setups, each one concentrated on particular geometry features:
Solids - builds all VGM supported solids Placements[2] - test for placements via translation and rotation Reflections - test positions with reflection for all solids AssembliesN - test volume assemblies N=1 - assemblies in more levels N=2 - assemblies with reflection BooleansSolidsM - test Boolean solids M=1 - Boolean solids with no displacement M=2 - Boolean solids with displacement including translation and rotation M=3 - Boolean solids with displacement including reflection DisplacedSolidsN - test solids with displacement N=1 - boxes with displacement N=2 - as BooleanSolids2 but with displacement is defined via Displaced solid ScaledSolids - test all VGM supported solids with scaled trasnformation and the same placements as in Reflections NewSolid - builds selected solid individually MultiUnion - test for multi union solid Special - loads external geometry from geometry.</description></item></channel></rss>
